They are created by the way light interacts with objects, and they can be categorized into primary colors (red, blue, and yellow), secondary colors (orange, green, and purple), and tertiary colors (mixtures of primary and secondary colors).

Wind speed and direction are determined by the movement of air masses across the Earth's surface. Wind plays a vital role in shaping weather patterns, redistributing heat and moisture and influencing factors such as temperature, precipitation, and cloud formation.
